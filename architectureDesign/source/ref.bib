title="The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Design Pattern",
bookTitle="Pro Business Applications with Silverlight 5",
year="2012",

pages="461--499",
abstract="Few topics surrounding Silverlight are so widely discussed as the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. This pattern is used by many Silverlight, Windows Phone 7, and WPF developers, and even JavaScript libraries are starting to appear that enable HTML applications to make use of the pattern. The blogosphere is overflowing with posts on this topic, with so many differing and varied opinions on how it should be implemented that you might become a little overwhelmed. Adding to this confusion is the fact that the project templates in Visual Studio do not facilitate using the MVVM design pattern out of the box, and with no information on the amount of prerequisite Silverlight knowledge required to implement it effectively, many developers new to Silverlight shun the pattern until they become more experienced in the technology. However, there is general agreement in the development community that, regardless of how you implement the pattern, doing so is good practice. Developers who implement this pattern invariably say that their code is much better for it.",
